# Three Sum (Medium)
## Description
Given and input array of integers, we want to calculate all the triplets of values in the array that add to 0.

## Runtime
For our solution we are essentially wrapping our $O(n)$ two sum sorted solution in another $O(n)$ outer loop, which gives us a $O(n^2)$ runtime.

## Solutions
See Python and JavaScript solutions in this directory.
